## The problem

Claude Code doesn't show you what you're spending. You finish a session, check your billing dashboard, and discover a $65 charge for what felt like 30 minutes of work. You have no idea which session caused it, which model was wasteful, or whether your cache was even working.

I built claudetop after noticing my model estimate showed $10 but the actual bill was $65. Turns out, compaction was hiding 80% of my token usage. The cost was real — the visibility wasn't.

## Install

### Clone and install (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liorwn/claudetop.git
cd claudetop && ./install.sh
```

### One-liner

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liorwn/claudetop/main/install.sh | bash
```

### As a Claude Code plugin

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add liorwn/claudetop
claude plugin install claudetop
```

This gives you the SessionEnd hook + all slash commands (`/claudetop:stats`, `/claudetop:dashboard`, `/claudetop:branch`, `/claudetop:export`, `/claudetop:pricing`) automatically.

Then restart Claude Code.

## What you see

### Before claudetop
```
>
```
A blank prompt. No context. No cost. No idea.

### After claudetop
```
14:32  my-project/src/app  Opus  20m 0s  +256/-43  #auth-refactor
152.3K in / 45.2K out  ████░░░░░░ 38%  $3.47  $5.10/hr  ~$174/mo
cache: 66%  efficiency: $0.012/line  opus:~$3.20  sonnet:~$0.88  haiku:~$0.23

Every response, you see:
- **What project** you're in and how deep
- **What model** is running and for how long
- **What it costs** right now, per hour, and projected monthly
- **How efficient** your cache is (are you wasting tokens?)
- **What it would cost** on a different model (should you switch?)
- **Smart alerts** when something is wrong

## Features

### Real-time cost tracking
Your actual session cost (green), burn rate per hour, and monthly forecast extrapolated from your history. No more billing surprises.

### Model cost comparison
See what your session would cost on Opus, Sonnet, or Haiku — with **cache-aware pricing** that accounts for your actual cache hit ratio. The current model is **bolded** so you can instantly compare.

Pricing updates automatically from the [pricing.json](pricing.json) in this repo — when Anthropic changes prices, claudetop stays current.

### Cache efficiency
Your cache hit ratio tells you if you're being efficient. Green (≥60%) means most of your input tokens are being reused. Red (<30%) means something is forcing full re-reads — maybe compaction, maybe a model switch.

### Smart alerts
Only appear when something needs your attention:

| Alert | What happened | What to do |
|-------|--------------|------------|
| `$5 MARK` / `$10` / `$25` | Cost milestone crossed | Gut-check: am I getting value? |
| `OVER BUDGET` | Daily budget exceeded | Wrap up or switch models |
| `CONSIDER FRESH SESSION` | >2hrs + >60% context | Start fresh — diminishing returns |
| `LOW CACHE` | <20% cache after 5min | Context was reset, tokens being re-read |
| `BURN RATE` | >$15/hr velocity | Runaway subagents or tight loops |
| `SPINNING?` | >$1 spent, zero code output | Stuck in a research loop |
| `TRY /fast` | >$0.05/line on Opus | This task doesn't need the biggest model |
| `COMPACT SOON` | Context window >80% full | Auto-compaction is imminent |

### Session history & analytics

Every session is automatically logged. See where your money goes:

```bash
claudetop-stats              # Today's summary
claudetop-stats week         # This week
claudetop-stats month        # This month
claudetop-stats all          # All time
claudetop-stats tag auth     # Filter by tag
```

```
claudetop-stats  This Week
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Summary
  Sessions:     12
  Total cost:   $47.30
  Avg / session:  $3.94
  Daily avg:      $9.46

Cost by model
  claude-opus-4-6:       $38.20
  claude-sonnet-4-6:     $9.10

Top projects by cost
  rri-os                 $22.50  (4 sessions)
  pistol-claw            $14.80  (5 sessions)
  the-table              $10.00  (3 sessions)
```

### Session tagging

Track costs per feature, bug, or initiative:

```bash
export CLAUDETOP_TAG=auth-refactor
# ... work on auth ...
claudetop-stats tag auth-refactor
# Total cost: $12.40 across 3 sessions
```

### Daily budget

```bash
export CLAUDETOP_DAILY_BUDGET=50
```

Shows `budget: $12 left` at 80% → `OVER BUDGET ($52/$50)` when exceeded.

### Themes

```bash
export CLAUDETOP_THEME=full      # Default: 3-5 lines
export CLAUDETOP_THEME=minimal   # 2 lines
export CLAUDETOP_THEME=compact   # 1 line
```

### iTerm2 integration

Push claudetop data into iTerm2's chrome — tab titles, status bar, and badge watermark:

```bash
export CLAUDETOP_ITERM=all           # Enable everything
export CLAUDETOP_ITERM=title         # Tab/window title only
export CLAUDETOP_ITERM=badge         # Watermark overlay only
export CLAUDETOP_ITERM=statusbar     # User variables for status bar
export CLAUDETOP_ITERM=bgcolor       # Background color tint by state
export CLAUDETOP_ITERM=title,badge   # Combine any options
```

**Tab title** — Shows `project | $4.21 | Opus 4.6 | ctx:38%` in your iTerm2 tab. Zero configuration.

**Badge** — Faint watermark in the terminal background with cost, model, and context at a glance. Great for keeping cost visible while scrolling through output.

**Background color** — Subtly tints the terminal background based on session state:

| Tint | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Green | Healthy session (low context, under $5) or session ended (idle/waiting) |
| Amber | Caution — cost milestone, compact soon, low cache, spinning |
| Red | Alert — over budget, burn rate spike, $25 mark |
| Default | Normal — no special state, uses your profile's background |

When a session ends, the background stays green so you can see at a glance which terminals are idle vs active. Resets to default when the next session starts clean.

**Status bar** — Sets iTerm2 user-defined variables that you can display in the status bar (top or bottom of terminal). Configure in iTerm2: Preferences > Profiles > Session > Status Bar > add "Interpolated String" components:

| Variable | Content | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `\(user.claudetop_cost)` | Session cost | `$4.21` |
| `\(user.claudetop_model)` | Current model | `Opus 4.6` |
| `\(user.claudetop_ctx)` | Context usage | `38%` |
| `\(user.claudetop_project)` | Project name | `my-project` |
| `\(user.claudetop_duration)` | Session time | `20m 0s` |
| `\(user.claudetop_cache)` | Cache hit ratio | `66%` |
| `\(user.claudetop_velocity)` | Burn rate | `$5.10/hr` |
| `\(user.claudetop_tokens_in)` | Input tokens | `152.3K` |
| `\(user.claudetop_tokens_out)` | Output tokens | `45.2K` |
| `\(user.claudetop_lines)` | Lines changed | `+256/-43` |
| `\(user.claudetop_tag)` | Session tag | `#auth-refactor` |

No-op on non-iTerm2 terminals — escape sequences are silently ignored.

### Context composition

See what's eating your context window:
```
in:80% out:20% (fresh:15% cwrite:7% cread:76%)
```

High `cread` = cache is working well. High `fresh` = re-reading files every turn.
